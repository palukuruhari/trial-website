Heart is a muscular pumping organ. It is located in the chest cavaty slightly to left.It is protected by a double wall sac called pericardium.
A pericardial fluid is present between heart wall and pericardium, it protects from jerks and shocks during contraction.The heart is made of
muscle cells called pericardial muscle fibres. Heart muscles work tirelessly throughtly the life of human.

The upper two chambers are left auricle and right auricle,The lower chambers are left and right ventricles.The right
 auricle and ventricle are called as left auricle and ventricle because that is to your left.

 <H3 align="center">process in which blood is circulated</H3>
 Oxygenated blood comes into left atrium and then it comes into the left ventricle through tricuspid valve then the left ventricle pumps it into aorta,
Then blood travells to all body parts from aorto,Then vena cava carries it to right atrium as deoxygenated blood,then it goes into the ventricle through
bicuspid valve.After the deoxygenated blood reaches right ventricle, The deoxygenated blood is pumped into the lungs for purification.Pulnomary artery
carries blood from right ventricle to lungs.After it is purified It goes to left atrium as oxygenated blood and this process repeats again and again 
throught the lifetime.

Aorta:Main artery which Carries blood from left ventricle to whole body.<BR>
<BR>
Pulmonary artery:Carries deoxygenated blood from right ventricle to lungs<BR>
<BR>
pulmonary vein:carries oxygenated blood from lungs to left atrium.<BR>
<BR>
Coronary artery:Carries blood to the heart muscles.<BR>
<BR>
Coronary Vein:Carries blood from the heart muscles.<BR>
